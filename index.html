                    <p>I first met him on Facebook. Facebook brought him to me. Many thanks to Facebook for this. Just as Facebook has done a lot of damage to my life, it has also done a lot of the opposite. The biggest thing Facebook has to give me is my favorite people. My love</p>

                <p> Suddenly one day it all ends. Lets finish. Lilavati's family puts an end to it all. The sound of her crying still rings in my ears. I couldn't hold him. Today he is far away. There was a time when if we didn't talk for an hour, we would both go crazy. But I'm still crazy but I can't talk like before. Here she is someone else's wife. It is not that he is good. His family has finished it all.</p>
